# ECB cut-and-paste

# This challenge is really just literally cut and past from a ciphertext to
# a crafted ciphertext. The only thing to find out is at which index to paste the
# encrypted 'role=admin' part. I was able to do all this in a few lines of code in
# an interactive Python session, so I'm skipping this.
