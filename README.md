## Cryptopals

These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com).

This is a set of 48 practical programming problems that give you a hands-on
crash course in understanding (and breaking!) cryptographic ciphers. The problems
are extremely fun to do, and most importantly - they are do-able. An excellent
introduction can be found in  [Maciej Ceglowski](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/)
blog post.

The exercises are bundled in 8 sets:

1. Basics (1-8)
2. Block crypto (9-16)
3. Block and stream crypto (17-24)
4. Stream crypto and randomness (25-32)
5. Diffie-Hellmann and friends (33-40)
6. RSA and DSA (41-48)
7. Hashes (49-56)
8. Abstract Algebra (57-66)


## Requirements

Python 3.10 or later.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or do a conda install of packages listed in requirements.txt.


## Tests

Many solutions have doctests. To run them all, run
```
python -m doctest challenge_*.py --verbose
```
