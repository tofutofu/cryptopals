## Cryptopals

These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com).

This is a set of 48 practical programming problems that give you a hands-on
crash course in understanding and breaking cryptographic ciphers. The problems
are extremely fun to do, and most importantly - they are do-able. An excellent
introduction can be found in  [Maciej Ceglowski](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/)
blog post.


## Requirements

Python 3.10 or later.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or do a conda install of packages listed in requirements.txt.


## Tests

Most solutions have doctests. To run them all, run
```
python -m doctest *.py --verbose
```
